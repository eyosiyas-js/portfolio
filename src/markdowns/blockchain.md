# Blockchain , Web3, Crypto? From Zero to Hero

&nbsp;

Are you intrigued by the buzz surrounding blockchain but find it challenging to wrap your head around the concept? Fear not! In this guide, we'll crack down **blockchain** in the simplest terms possible, using real-world examples to help you grasp its fundamental concepts

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Understanding Blockchain

&nbsp;

Imagine a giant digital registry, similar to a shared record book accessible by everyone. This registry, known as a **blockchain**, records transactions across multiple interconnected computers or nodes. Each transaction is verified and added to the blockchain by these nodes, creating a decentralized network where no single entity has control

Think of a blockchain network like a global network of banks. When you make a transaction, it's as if each bank independently verifies and records the transaction, ensuring transparency and security without relying on a central authority

# Nodes: The Backbone of Blockchain

Blockchain Nodes

Now lets talk About Nodes. Nodes are individual computers or devices connected to a blockchain network. They maintain a **copy of the entire blockchain and participate in the validation and verification of transactions**

Imagine each node as a bank branch in our global network. Each branch maintains its own records of transactions while collaborating with others to ensure consistency across the entire banking network

### <span style="background-color:red">**the more nodes, the more the blockchain strong**, but how ?</span>

strength of a blockchain network grows with the increasing number of nodes due to several key factors.
**Firstly**, higher decentralization emerges as more nodes participate, mitigating the risk of single points of failure and enhancing resistance against censorship or attacks. **what does it mean** ?

when there are only a few nodes in a blockchain network, there is a risk that someone could add more nodes under their control in an attempt to influence the network

**Secondly**, security intensifies as each additional node contributes to maintaining copies of the ledger, making it more challenging for malicious actors to manipulate data.

But Wait. We have used the word **Transaction** a lot, what is it?

A **transaction** in the context of blockchain refers to the transfer of digital assets (such as cryptocurrencies) or the execution of a **smart contract**. It involves the exchange of value between two parties and is recorded on the blockchain

Hold on! , when we talk about Transactions there is one thing we should know, its called **Gas**

whats **Gas** ?

In the world of blockchain, gas is like the fuel that powers transactions. Every action you perform on the blockchain, whether it's sending cryptocurrency or executing a smart contract, requires a certain amount of gas to be expended, which means every time you make a transaction you going to pay some Gas price,

### <span style="background-color:red">**How gas price is measured** ?</span>

Gas is measured in units called "gwei," which is a fraction of ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. When you initiate a transaction or execute a smart contract, you specify the amount of gas you're willing to pay for that action. The more complex the transaction or contract, the more gas it requires

So basically When you send a transaction, you set two parameters: the **gas price** and the **gas limit**. The gas price determines the fee you're willing to pay per unit of gas, while the gas limit sets the maximum amount of gas you're willing to spend on the transaction

So the total fee for your Transaction will be the **Gas Price x Gas used**

But here I'm sure you got a lot of questions here such as for who am i going to Pay, why should i pay even?

Yes, thats a right think to ask, Don't worry we will touch everything soon

# Smart Contracts: Automating Agreements

&nbsp;

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined rules written in code. They automate the execution of agreements without the need for intermediaries.

Suppose you want to rent out your apartment using a smart contract. The contract could automatically release the keys to the renter once the payment is received, eliminating the need for a rental agency to facilitate the process.

### **<span style="background-color:red"> So, how do Smart Contracts work exactly ?</span> **

Smart contracts do not contain legal language or terms of a contract between two parties. They are scripts written in programming languages such as Solidity that consist of if/then statements, functions, module imports, and other programming elements aimed at automating the actions specified in a contract, and these Smart Contracts are deployed on the Blochian network it self, and they execute there too

# Consensus Mechanisms

Consensus mechanisms are protocols used to achieve agreement among nodes in a blockchain network. They ensure that all nodes in the network can reach a common understanding about the validity of transactions and the state of the blockchain

There are two types of Consensus mechanisms: **Proof of Work (PoW)** AND **Proof of Stake (PoS)**

&nbsp;

### **<span style="background-color:red">Proof of Work(PoW) </span> **

Proof of Work is a consensus mechanism where miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate and add new blocks to the blockchain. The first miner to solve the puzzle earns the right to add the block and is rewarded with cryptocurrency.

### **<span style="background-color:red">Proof of Stake(PoS) </span> **

Proof of Stake is a consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create and validate new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold or have staked in the network. Validators are rewarded with transaction fees or newly minted coins.

&nbsp;

# Double Spending: Fraud

Double spending refers to the act of spending the same digital currency more than once. It is a potential threat to the integrity of a blockchain network and is prevented through consensus mechanisms and cryptographic techniques

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

# Mining and Block Creation

Now let's talk first about Block,

A block is a data structure containing a set of transactions that are validated and added to the blockchain. Each block typically contains a reference to the previous block, forming a chain of blocks, hence the name blockchain.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### **What's Inside a Block? Let's Take a Peek!**


![enter image description here](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20221111160733/Structureofblocksinblockchain.png)




Picture a block in a blockchain as a digital treasure chest. But instead of gold coins, it's filled with three key things:



- Block Header: Think of this as the block's ID card. It holds important info like when the block was made, where it fits in the chain (by referencing the previous block), and a special number that helps keep everything secure(Nonce).

- List of Transactions: Inside the block, there's a list of all the transactions that happened. These could be anything from buying a cup of coffee to trading cryptocurrencies. Each transaction is like a story waiting to be told!

- Block Hash: This is the block's fingerprint. It's a unique code that's created by mixing up the block's header and transaction list. This fingerprint helps ensure that nobody can tamper with the block's contents.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Now, imagine each block as a link in a digital chain. They're all connected, with each block pointing back to the one before it. This creates a chain of blocks, aka a **blockchain**! It's like a digital diary of transactions, where each entry builds on the last.

**<span style="background-color:red">Keeping the Blockchain Honest </span> **

Before a block can join the blockchain party, it needs to go through a bit of scrutiny. All the transactions inside the block get checked to make sure they're legit. This process helps keep the blockchain honest and ensures that only valid transactions make it into the chain.

**<span style="background-color:red">Mining: The Digital Treasure Hunt </span> **

Now, here's where things get really exciting! Mining is like a digital treasure hunt where miners use powerful computers to solve complex puzzles. The first miner to crack the code gets to add a new block to the blockchain. It's a bit like striking gold in the digital world! Miners, and receive gas fees as rewards for their work. They prioritize transactions with higher gas prices because it's more profitable for them

You see, It appears that the question regarding who is responsible for taking the gas has been sufficiently answered, don't you think?

**So lets make things revise and clear hear**

When you make a transaction in a blockchain, you're essentially sending digital information (like cryptocurrency or data) from one person to another. This transaction is recorded in a block, which is a piece of data stored in the blockchain. Once added, it becomes a permanent part of the blockchain's history and can't be altered. So, making a transaction in a blockchain means securely and permanently transferring digital assets or information from one party to another.

So if you remember When you make a transaction in a blockchain, miners validate it before adding it to the blockchain. As part of this process, you specify two parameters: the gas price and gas limit. The gas price represents the fee you're willing to pay per unit of computational resources, while the gas limit defines the maximum amount of resources you're willing to consume for the transaction.

Miners prioritize transactions based on the transaction fee, which is calculated by multiplying the gas price by the gas limit. Transactions offering higher fees are usually processed faster because miners are incentivized to include them in blocks to earn more fees. Therefore, setting a higher gas price can expedite the processing of your transaction.

# Broadcasting and Updating the Blockchain

&nbsp;

Once a new block is created, it is broadcasted to all nodes in the network, and each node updates its copy of the blockchain.

imagine Broadcasting a new block is akin to sharing breaking news with a global audience. Once verified, the news spreads to every corner of the world, ensuring that everyone is informed.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#  WEB 3.0

Web3 is a term used to describe the vision of a decentralized internet built on blockchain technology. Traditional web applications rely on centralized servers controlled by specific entities. Web3 seeks to change this by enabling a peer-to-peer network where users have more control over their data and interactions.

At its core, Web3 is linked to blockchain technology because blockchains provide the foundation for decentralization. Blockchains are distributed ledgers that record transactions across a network of computers in a secure and transparent manner. They offer features like immutability, transparency, and security, which are essential for building decentralized applications (dApps) and services.
